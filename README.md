# moving_ball 
Descrpton:
      The HTML code creates a webpage with a ball (styled as a div element) that has a cyan background color and a circular shape (border-radius: 50%). The ball is positioned absolutely on the page and initially placed at the top-left corner (top: 0px, left: 0px). The JavaScript code defines variables for position (xmin, ymin), velocity, time interval, maximum positions (xmax, ymax), and references the ball element. The move function animates the ball to move diagonally within the defined area. The setInterval function is used to repeatedly call the move function at the specified time interval (500 milliseconds).
